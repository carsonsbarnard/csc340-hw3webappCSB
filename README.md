Homework Assignment 2 (technincally 3 if you count week 1), Static Web App Development

For my project I decided to make my "business" a music sharing platform (kind of like a blog?) where I have tons of 
music I listen to, that had a profound impact on me listed.

My app was stylized using bootstrap and it's wonderful configuration I was able to find, everything looked super sleek
and modern and I enjoyed creating my site using it.

My about page lists some reasons behind the creation of the page as well as well as some input behind some of the choices
made in the music listed (but I left descriptions on the main page as well of most of the albums listed!).

My contact me page lists my music email where I am taking submissions for anything to be added onto the website at a later date!
If you personally had any music recommendations, I'd love to listen to them, so send them through!

I used two logos that I own, one I created in about 10 minutes in Paint, and the other is professional album art that I had commissioned
for me a couple years ago (for a project I'm still yet to release). Those are the two images I have listed (other than the album art).

My two child pages link back to each other and the main page, and I even left a little copyright tag at the bottom of each page just for fun.

Overall, the assignment was actually quite a bit of fun. Maybe I have a knack for web development. Although I'm sure the years
of messing around in inspect element definitely helped a bit! Lol.
